  display: inline-block;
  // now the motive is to match the text color to the background color which is linear gradient.
  // we do this using two props below. -webkit-background-clip: text; and color:transparent.

  // -webkit-background-clip: text; allows to clip/ cut the background exactly behind the text. So imagine that the color is behind our text
  // and at this point we can't see the background because text is covering that so we make the text transparent to let only the background show up

  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  color: transparent; // making this invisible so that background becomes visible
  background-clip: 0; // this is not necessary but adding to avoid the error caused by webkit above
