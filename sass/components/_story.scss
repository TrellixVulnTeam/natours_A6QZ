    // not only circle but we can also use polygon and others just like clip-path
    // in circle we can define size, position and center of the circle like below

    // first param 50% tells the radius of the circle. Radius in this case is 50% of width and height of element. 7.5rem in this case which means diameter is equal to shape size
    // last two params 50% 50% says the center of the circle, 50% horizontally and 50% verticallty
    -webkit-shape-outside: circle(50% at 50% 50%); // for safari
    shape-outside: circle(50% at 50% 50%);
